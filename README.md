üé≠ Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

This project builds a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras.
It detects human emotions from facial images and classifies them into categories like Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Fear, Surprise, and Disgust.

üìò Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to recognize human emotions from facial expressions.
We use a publicly available Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset from Kaggle and build a CNN model to classify emotions based on facial features.
